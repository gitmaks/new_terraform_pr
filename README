This file includes only general description of the project.
The main configuration of tf project is in main.tf file;
task.tf file was created for ECS stack.
main.tf: created 1 VPC; 9 subnets, 1 IGW; 1 route_table linked to GW, 2 route table association
for stack of APP subnets and ALB; 1 load balancer; 1 RDS db instance, a subnet group for it,
security group for RDS.
A new docker image was created for the ECS task: dockerfile and the script it uses are located in Docker
folder. Container definition includes the link (reference) to the docker image in my dockerhub.
The login details for the database are set up as variables (all variables are available in variables.tf file);
the password does not have value: it's required to set it up during "apply".
The login details used for the db connection check are set up in container_definitions file (task.json)
These details are set up as environment variables that will be moved to the container and used by
python script through "os" library.
It's expected that the login details for AWS account access are exported (export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="value"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="value")
The task should work properly; didn't have time to finish "ECS stack"
Have a good day!
